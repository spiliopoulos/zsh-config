## USE THE SEARCH LUKE

> May the Force (of past experiences) be with you.

Trust me, that works 90% of the time.

You can also take a look at the [FAQ](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/FAQ)
to be sure it hasn't already come up.

If all fails, your thing hasn't probably been reported yet, so you can go ahead
and read on to the next section.


## YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

See [point 1](#use-the-search-luke).

If the problem is already reported, comment on the issue so we can know there's
more people with the problem.

If not, look at the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Troubleshooting)
page for instructions on how to gather data to better debug your problem.

Then, you can go ahead and submit an issue with as much detail as you can provide.
We'll do our very best to help you.

*TODO: fill later*


## YOU HAVE A SOLUTION

See [point 1](#use-the-search-luke).

If the solution is already reported, try it out and +1 the pull request if the
solution works ok. On the other hand, if you think your solution is better, post
it so we can have both solutions to compare.

If not, then go ahead and submit a PR.
**Unless your solution is yet another [theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes#dont-send-us-your-theme-for-now).**
